# Disentanglement Transformer
This repository is made to reproduce results from the paper.

A model can be trained by running ```disentangle_train.py``` with default arguments.
The checkpoint for trained parameters used for our analysis is provided under the experiment name
``nlilm/StructuredAutoreg5``.
The analysis of the model is performed using the jupyter notebook ```Model_Analysis.ipynb``` 
under the folder ```disentanglement_transformer```.

Documentation and usage guidelines are still a work in progress. Don't hesitate to file an issue
if you have questions.
